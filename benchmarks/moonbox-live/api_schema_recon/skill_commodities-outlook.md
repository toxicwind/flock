## Exhibit Requirements

- **Quantity**: Target 15-16 substantial exhibits for a ~19-page report. Each major theme needs 2-4 supporting exhibits.
- **Types**: Multi-panel time-series (dual-axis), grouped/stacked bar charts, regression scatter plots, data tables, framework diagrams.
- **Cross-references**: Every exhibit referenced in body text as "(Exhibit N)" or "Exhibit N, left panel"
- **Source attribution**: Every exhibit has a source line

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Inputs

- Target year/period for the outlook
- Commodity sectors to cover (energy, metals, agriculture)
- Key macro assumptions (GDP growth, Fed policy, geopolitical backdrop)
- Specific trade convictions or views to highlight
- Author/team attribution

### Step 2: Build Structure

1. Define 2-4 thematic themes based on macro thesis
2. Map each commodity sector to themes
3. Draft 5-8 key takeaway bullets for cover page
4. Compile 3-4 Top Trades with empty-square markers
5. Plan ~15-16 exhibits with data sources

### Step 3: Draft Content

For each theme, follow the narrative pattern:
- **Opening thesis** → 1-2 paragraph overview
- **Macro context** → link to top-down story with cross-referenced exhibits
- **Supply-side analysis** → production, inventories, spare capacity
- **Demand-side analysis** → regional demand, structural vs cyclical drivers
- **Price forecast** → base case with bull/bear sensitivity
- **Trade recommendation** → bold recommendation statement embedded in text
