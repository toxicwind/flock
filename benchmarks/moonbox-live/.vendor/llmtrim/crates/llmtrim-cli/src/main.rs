//! llmtrim CLI.

//! Network-free surface: `compress` reads a provider request body on stdin and writes the

Get started:
  setup      Set everything up and start saving (CA, env, autostart, integrations, daemon)
  status     Show the savings dashboard + interceptor health  [aliases: monitor, gain]
  update     Update to the latest release and refresh integrations
  ensure     Bring this machine to the recommended current state
  wrap       Launch an agent (claude, codex, …) routed through the interceptor
  sub        Reroute Claude Code to another subscription's backend (codex|kimi|grok)
  agents     Install routed Claude Code subagents (Grok, Codex/Terra, Kimi)
  tray       Open the desktop tray app (savings menu-bar / system-tray)

Daemon:
  start      Start the background interceptor (no-op if already running)
  stop       Stop the background interceptor
  autostart  Run the interceptor at login (--off to disable)

When something's wrong:
  doctor     Check the install end-to-end; `--fix` applies repairs
  uninstall  Undo everything `setup` did

Pipes & one-shots:
  compress   Compress a request from stdin to stdout
  send       Compress a request, send it to the provider, print the response
  recall     Recover raw bytes from an ephemeral recall handle
  serve      Run the HTTPS interceptor in the foreground
  ca         Print the local CA certificate path and how to trust it

Measurement (dev):
  eval       Measure retrieval recall + token savings on a corpus
  bench      A/B benchmark: tokens saved vs quality retained, on a real model
  discover   Scan the capture corpus for where tokens still escape compression

Options:
