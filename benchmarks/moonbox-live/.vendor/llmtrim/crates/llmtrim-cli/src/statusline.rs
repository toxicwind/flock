//! `statusline` — one elegant line for Claude Code's custom status line.
//!
//! Claude Code pipes a JSON session blob on stdin and renders whatever the command
//! prints (see <https://code.claude.com/docs/en/statusline>). This module reads that
//! blob, folds in llmtrim's own live signals from the ledger + config (compression
//! saved, interceptor health, the active `sub` reroute), and prints a single
//! width-adaptive line:
//!
//! ```text
//! ◆ Opus→gpt-5.6-terra   ▓▓▓▓▓░░░ 142k   ✂ 6.8%   ◔ 3h·24% · 4d·12%   ♻ 63% cached
//! ```
//!
//! The three left segments (model→backend, context, ✂ trim) are core and never
//! truncate; the extras (5h/7d quota, then this turn's prompt-cache reuse) shed right-to-left
//! as the terminal narrows (`COLUMNS`). The context gauge fills and colours against the *real*
//! window of the model serving the turn — the rerouted backend's window under `sub`, not
//! Claude's — green below 40%, orange 40–65%, red above; and red whenever the prompt cache has
//! gone cold, where the cache segment becomes `♻ cache cold`. Segments whose data is
//! absent — no reroute, an API-key user with no rate limits — simply don't render.
//!
//! Under `sub`, the quota segment prefers the active provider's windows (cached under
//! `~/.llmtrim/sub-rate-limits.json` by the proxy when a Codex turn fires) over Claude Code's
//! Anthropic blob, but only once a matching snapshot exists and the proxy is healthy —
//! otherwise the Claude blob stays so a fresh always-mode session isn't blank for minutes.
//! Weekly is always shown when known; the short (~5h) window only appears when the provider
//! reports one. Kimi/Grok fill in later.
//!
//! Under `sub` the arrow shows the concrete model that served the last turn (e.g.
//! `→gpt-5.6-terra`) for Codex reroutes; Kimi shows the provider shortname (`→kimi`), since all
//! its tiers collapse to one internal wire id. The arrow is read from the ledger — what actually
//! answered — not from config, because in `fallback` mode config predicts nothing: Anthropic
//! serves the turn and the chain fires only if it fails. So there the arrow appears only on turns
//! a backend really served, and the gauge keeps Claude's window until one does.
//!
//! `install` wires it into `~/.claude/settings.json`; rendering itself never touches the
//! network or API tokens (the proxy polls usage on the request path; this process only reads
//! the resulting cache file).

// ── sub always-on: skip Claude Code's Anthropic OAuth ─────────────────────────
//
// Claude Code gates every turn (including `/compact`) on a live Anthropic OAuth session even
// when llmtrim rewrites the request to Grok/Codex/Kimi. claude-code-proxy avoids that by
// launching Claude with `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=unused`. We do the same via Claude's own
// `settings.json` `env` block when global `sub` is always-on *and* `sub.anthropic_login = skip`
// (the default) — Claude never starts the OAuth flow, and the MITM still strips the dummy token
// and injects the real provider token.
//
// Trade-off: Claude Code treats any ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN / API key as taking precedence over
// claude.ai login, so **claude.ai connectors are disabled** while our dummy is set. Users who
// need connectors run `llmtrim sub anthropic-login keep` (and stay logged in to Anthropic).
//
// The dummy token alone is not enough. Shell profiles only export `HTTPS_PROXY` when the
// daemon is alive *at shell start*, and non-interactive / IDE / remote launches often never
// source those profiles. Claude then sends `Authorization: Bearer llmtrim-sub` straight to
// api.anthropic.com → `401 Invalid bearer token` / "Please run /login". So the skip-login
// package also writes the MITM proxy URL + CA trust into `settings.json` `env`, which Claude
// loads regardless of how it was launched.
//
// Unlike the shell block, settings deliberately do **not** gate on daemon liveness: Claude
// cannot re-read the profile mid-session, and a dummy token without a proxy is always worse
// than a proxy that is temporarily down (connection error vs. "Please run /login"). When
// skip-login turns off, the whole package is removed.
//
// Ownership: only touch the key when missing or already set to our sentinel value. Never
// overwrite a real API key the user put there, and never remove a foreign value on `sub off`.
// We deliberately do *not* manage CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC — that flag is a
// boolean `"1"` we cannot own without risking a user's pre-existing preference.
