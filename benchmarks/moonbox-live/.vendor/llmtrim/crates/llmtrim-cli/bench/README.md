# llmtrim benchmark

Two axes, measured live: **tokens saved** (real tokenizer, at compress time) and **quality retained** (the A/B delta between the model's answer on the *original* vs the *compressed* request). A preset is only honest if quality holds at its token saving: the frontier of (saved, retained) is the benchmark, not the saving alone.

- **Model:** `qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct` via OpenRouter (async-openai byot: the exact compressed body is sent, injected fields intact). A cheap, strong, **non-reasoning** instruct model: its visible output is the whole billed output, so prompt-side output shaping (terse / Chain-of-Draft) translates to real cost. Reasoning models bill hidden chain-of-thought as output that no prompt-side lever can cut, so the cost win shrinks there.
- **Scoring:** ground-truth where possible (numeric-exact for math, pass@1 that *runs the unit tests* for code), token-F1 for extractive QA, tool-call match for agents, an LLM judge only for open-ended shapes.
- **Cost:** priced from a pinned [models.dev](https://models.dev) snapshot (`bench/pricing.json`), cached input billed at the `cache_read` rate.
- **Cache used %:** share of compressed input served from the provider prompt cache (`usage.prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens`).


## Bottom line

Across **112 A/B cases** on this real-usage mix (generation, chat, reasoning, code, RAG, agent, summary, cache):

| | original | compressed | saved |
|---|--:|--:|--:|
| input tokens | 71,031 | 49,062 | **31%** |
| output tokens | 25,843 | 6,628 | **74%** |
| **total tokens** | **96,874** | **55,690** | **43%** |
| **round-trip cost** | **$0.0365** | **$0.0126** | **66%** |
| **answer quality** | **78.9%** | **82.2%** | **+3.3pp** |

**~66% cost cut, quality up +3.3pp.** Output is where it pays off: output tokens drop 74% via output-control, and real workloads are output-heavy. The cost % rides on the model's output:input price ratio (≈12:1 here); the underlying token cuts are model-independent (−31% input, −74% output), projecting to −57% / −59% at GPT-4o / Claude Sonnet rates and −44% on the input-heavy gpt-oss-20b. (An earlier input-heavy/short-output mix saved only ~9%; the lever was real but had nothing to cut, and representative corpora surface the true savings.)


## Frontier

| corpus | shape | n | input saved | output saved | cost saved | cache used | quality (orig→comp) | retention |
|---|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|:--:|--:|
| `gsm8k` | Reasoning (CoT) | 12 | -47% | 77% | 71% | 0% | 100%→92% | -8pp |

| `tl_ours` | Tool output (logs) | 5 | 88% | 93% | 89% | 0% | 100%→100% | +0pp |
| `tl_rtk` | Tool output (grep) | 5 | -29% | 87% | 66% | 0% | 100%→100% | +0pp |

## Named academic benchmarks

The same A/B on the standard suites, at a conservative shape-matched preset (`qwen3-next-80b`, n=20 each, paired 95% CI). GSM8K is in the frontier above; the other three are the named benchmarks readers compare against.

| benchmark | task | scorer | preset | input saved | quality (orig→comp) | retention |
|---|---|---|---|--:|:--:|--:|
| GSM8K | grade-school math | numeric-exact | reasoning | -47% | 100%→92% | -8pp |
| TruthfulQA (MC1) | factual truthfulness | choice-exact | safe | 0% | 75%→75% | +0.0±0.0pp |
| SQuAD v2 | extractive QA | token-F1 / EM | rag | 11% | 84%→84% | -0.0±15.2pp |
| BFCL (live_multiple) | function calling | tool-call match | agent | 33% | 95%→95% | +0.0±15.2pp |

BFCL and SQuAD v2 are the compression wins at no quality cost: BFCL drops the tool schemas the query doesn't need (a 2-to-37 tool menu) for 33% input saved, SQuAD v2 cuts 11% while handling its unanswerable questions correctly (a right "no answer" scores as a hit). TruthfulQA MC1 is the quality-preservation row: a ~75-token prompt that is almost all answer text, so the safe preset finds nothing to cut and factual accuracy holds exactly. GSM8K is the one measured dip (-8pp at the reasoning preset). Evidence + reproduce: [snapshots/named-benchmarks/README.md](snapshots/named-benchmarks/README.md).

## Key findings

**Where compression wins big** (cost cut, quality held or up):
- Tool output (`toolout`/`tl_ours`/`tl_rtk`): **cost −66% to −89%**, quality 100%→100%, the cleanest win (logs/diffs/grep are mostly droppable noise).
- `dolly`: **cost −89%**, quality 75%→83% (+8pp).
- `chat`: **cost −71%**, quality 25%→33% (+8pp).
- `hotpotqa`: **cost −42%**, quality 55%→76% (+21pp); retrieval drops distractors the model was tripping on.

**Where it can't help** (nothing to cut): `glaive` (short tool-call output, cost −5%), `cache` (prefix already cached). `gsm8k` is the one quality dip (−8pp at n=12): the reasoning preset's Chain-of-Draft scaffold trades a small accuracy risk for −71% cost, so measure per workload before enabling.

**The headline:** the per-stage **token gate guarantees fewer tokens, not preserved quality**, and only this A/B quality axis catches the difference. The two regressions we confirmed and fixed were measured on **gpt-oss-20b** (a stronger model with tighter intervals): `code`'s compact-code output **−21.6±14.5pp** at n=37 → dropped from the preset; and `aggressive`+n-gram on `adult` **−100pp** (deterministic) → `ngram` now skips JSON records (recovers to 100%). On a weaker/noisier model the same levers mostly land inside their CIs, so measure per model, and reserve lossy stages for inputs whose exact surface form the task doesn't depend on.

## Reading the numbers honestly

- **No single compression %:** it is input-shape dependent. Long/structured inputs (RAG, record arrays, long docs) win on *input* tokens; short prompts (math, code stubs) can go *negative* on input because `output_control` injects a fixed instruction whose payoff is **output-side** (shorter answers), invisible in the input measure. Read **cost saved**, which captures both.
- **Cache used % is ~0 for one-shot diverse prompts** (nothing to cache-hit across distinct requests) and high only when a long prefix repeats; see `cache` (fixed system dossier + varying queries), the canonical agent/RAG-over-fixed-context shape.
- **Small n:** these runs use modest n for cost; CIs are reported in the JSON. Scale n for tighter intervals; several deltas here sit inside their CI (noise).
- **pass@1 actually executes** the model's code against the unit tests, the strongest signal here (no judge noise).


## Improvements driven by these results

The benchmark is actionable, not just descriptive; each row below is a code change the frontier forced:

- **`ngram` → prose-only guard.** `adult` 100%→0% (deterministic) traced to n-gram glossary abbreviation of JSON records → the model miscounts. Fix: `ngram` now skips any segment holding a JSON array of objects; abbreviates prose only. `adult` recovers to 100%.
- **`code` preset → dropped `output_compact_code`.** Confirmed real at n=37 (pass@1 −21.6pp, CI ±14.5, interval clear of zero). Minified-code *output* costs correctness on a small model; the −36% lever (arXiv:2508.13666) holds only via fine-tuning. Now opt-in.
- **`glaive` / `agent` preset → no change.** The −8pp at n=12 was **noise**: at n=39, retention is **+0.0pp** (CI ±5.2). Verifying before acting avoided a wrong fix.
- **New presets.** `reasoning` (Chain-of-Draft): GSM8K +17pp, compression *improving* accuracy. `cache` (stable prefix + Stage A): ~92% of input served from cache on fixed-prefix workloads.
- **Meta.** The per-stage **token gate guarantees fewer tokens, not preserved quality**, and only this A/B quality axis catches `adult`/`humaneval`. Lossy stages are now bundled only where measured safe.


## Reproduce

```bash
make -C crates/llmtrim-cli/bench data          # pull + normalize corpora (pinned in data/manifest.json)
cargo run -q --features live -- bench suite     # live A/B across all corpora (needs OPENROUTER_API_KEY)
cd crates/llmtrim-cli/bench/scripts && PYTHONPATH=. python3 -m benchkit.tools.synth_readme   # regenerate this file
```

`bench suite` runs the full corpus matrix in one process and writes one enveloped result
JSON per corpus to `bench/results/` (gitignored scratch). To keep a run as evidence, copy it
into `bench/snapshots/` (by date for the corpus frontier, `vs-<tool>` for head-to-heads). The
other axes share the same dispatcher:

```bash
llmtrim bench quality --corpus bench/data/<c>.jsonl --preset aggressive --ablate  # per-stage ablation (offline, free)
llmtrim bench agent                        # per-iteration token economics (dry-run; --live for real)
llmtrim bench latency                      # warm compress-path latency + attribution (offline)
llmtrim bench compare headroom             # head-to-head vs Headroom (dispatches the Python comparator)
```


## How llmtrim compares to the field

The competitor suite (`benchkit`) runs each tool on the axis it was built for and never mixes
axes in one table. Tokens are counted on the same `o200k_base` encoder for every tool. The input
table is deterministic and offline ($0); the output A/B is the only paid leg. Add a tool by
implementing the `Competitor` interface, not by forking the harness
([scripts/README.md](scripts/README.md)).

### Input (deterministic, $0)

Token reduction over the prompt and context (public corpora: gsm8k, hotpotqa, squad2,
truthfulqa, cnn, LongBench), every tool on the same encoder:

| tool | reduction | n | knob | reproduce |
|---|--:|--:|---|---|
| llmtrim `auto` | 25% | 50 | quality-gated default | `bench.py headroom --limit 5` |
| llmtrim `aggressive` | 28% | 50 | accepts lossy cuts where the gate holds | `bench.py headroom --limit 5` |
| Headroom (ML on) | 24% | 50 | 0% with ML disabled (routers no-op on prose) | `bench.py headroom --no-ml` |
| leanctx / LLMLingua-2 | 52% .. 81% | 40 | lossy keep-ratio (`keep0.50` 52%, `keep0.20` 81%) | `bench.py leanctx --limit 4` |
| entroly | 80% .. 89% | 80 | lossy budget/distill (`en-0.4` 80%, `en-max` 89%) | `bench.py entroly --limit 8` |

leanctx and entroly reach a bigger reduction by dropping content. That is a token win, not a
quality-matched one. A live A/B confirms the cost: at matched compression leanctx scores 0.49
vs llmtrim's 0.60 (n=20, gap significant), and entroly, which has no low-reduction mode, scores
0.18 vs llmtrim's 0.31 even while cutting far more (69% vs 25%). llmtrim's reduction figures
come from the vs-Headroom sweep (n=50); leanctx and entroly now have committed live snapshots
([vs-leanctx](snapshots/vs-leanctx/README.md), [vs-entroly](snapshots/vs-entroly/README.md)).

### Output (paid live)

Both cut the model's OUTPUT tokens by asking for terser responses, measured on a paid live call
over 9 coding prompts. caveman injects a 949-token system prompt (its SKILL.md) on every request;
llmtrim's `output_terse` uses 19 tokens. caveman cut output 80% and llmtrim 69%, but caveman pays
that 949-token overhead on every call, so on short or one-shot prompts the
overhead can outweigh the output saving ([snapshots/vs-caveman/README.md](snapshots/vs-caveman/README.md), `bench.py caveman`).

## Head-to-head: Headroom

Both libraries run through their Python APIs on the same inputs and the same `o200k_base`
denominator, against Headroom's pinned latest release (`headroom-ai==0.26.0`) over public
corpora. The metric is cost per unit of answer quality, plus the full token, latency, and
no-ML breakdown. Method and limitations are in [BENCH_SPEC.md](BENCH_SPEC.md); the generated
tables are in [snapshots/vs-headroom/README.md](snapshots/vs-headroom/README.md).

`make bench` and `llmtrim bench compare headroom` run the same harness; `make` is the
from-a-source-checkout path (it builds the wheel, installs the pinned deps, and fetches the
corpora), while the CLI is the front door once llmtrim and the Python deps are installed.
Both dispatch `bench/scripts/bench.py headroom` under the hood.

```bash
make -C crates/llmtrim-cli/bench setup        # build+install the wheel, pinned deps, corpora
make -C crates/llmtrim-cli/bench bench         # deterministic axes ($0, offline)
make -C crates/llmtrim-cli/bench bench LIVE=1  # + live cost A/B (needs OPENROUTER_API_KEY)
```

Headroom is imported from the pinned PyPI build, not a local checkout, so the numbers
reproduce. `make bench NOML=1` runs Headroom with its ML model disabled; `make check` is the
CI gate that asserts llmtrim's deterministic reduction against `baseline.json`.
