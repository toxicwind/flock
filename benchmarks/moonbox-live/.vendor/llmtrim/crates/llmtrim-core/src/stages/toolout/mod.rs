//! Stage T — tool-output compression (feature #1).
//!
//! Tool results (logs, diffs, grep output) are the bulk of an agent's context and the
//! noisiest: 10k-line build logs around a handful of errors, 200-line diffs changing
//! three lines, grep dumps with one relevant hit per file. The prose-oriented stages
//! (retrieve, ngram) don't fit this shape. This stage detects the *kind* of each tool
//! output and routes it to a purpose-built lexical compressor:
//!
//! - **log**  → lossless template fold, then level/stack-aware line selection
//! - **diff** → file/hunk capping + context trimming (grammar, not folding: template
//!   collapse would corrupt patch semantics)
//! - **grep** → lossless template fold, then query-relevant windowing with a
//!   one-match-per-file *floor* (a keep-more guarantee, never a drop rule)
//!
//! The shape detectors contribute only structure *hints* (what a file field is, which
//! tokens are failure levels, where hunks begin); none of them owns a drop policy. The
//! drop policy is one shared recipe — fold losslessly first, ship that if it fits, else
//! window under an adaptive budget (`crate::stages::sizing`) with dropped runs
//! becoming positional elision markers (`[… N lines omitted …]`, like the `retrieve`
//! stage) — plus three universal rails that apply to every windowed segment, current
//! and future kinds alike:
//!
//! 1. **Attribution** (`rebuild`): windowed output opens with a self-identifying
//!    header naming llmtrim and the recovery action, so an agent never misattributes
//!    the elision to the tool (or to whatever wrapper ran it).
//! 2. **Repeat → passthrough** ([`ToolOutputStage::apply`]): when a candidate's content
//!    already appears earlier in the request — the agent re-ran the tool to get the
//!    dropped detail back — the newest occurrence ships in full. Equality is on a
//!    volatile-value-masked fingerprint (`template::fingerprint`), since re-runs are
//!    rarely byte-identical (timings, timestamps, PIDs). This is what makes the
//!    header's "re-run the tool" promise true: compression is deterministic, so
//!    without this rail a retry would be windowed identically and the agent would
//!    conclude the tool itself is broken.
//! 3. **Never inflate** (`elide_into`): an elision marker is emitted only when it is
//!    shorter than the lines it hides; a lone `--` separator survives as itself.
//!
//! Live-zone windowing is lossy. First-arrival cache-boundary results receive recoverable
//! windowing by default on auto-routed agent requests: an admitted result gets an opaque recall
//! handle, while its raw bytes live only in the daemon memory store for five hours by default.
//! When recovery is disabled or admission fails, the boundary receives terminal-equivalent
//! normalization only. Without an admission hint, template folding and lossy
//! windowing stay live-zone-only. The combined stage is `InputTokens`-gated (reverts if it doesn't
//! cut tokens), `Content`-scoped, and uses zero model calls.
//!
//! Note on universality: the level/failure keywords scored below are tokens
//! *machine-emitted* by runtimes and build tools (`ERROR`, `FATAL`, `Traceback`,
//! `panicked`), not human prose, so a fixed set is appropriate. Locale-specific terms
//! from the user's request are handled by the query-overlap bonus, which is
//! Unicode-segmented via `lex_words`.
