//! Turn-stable compression memo — byte-identical frozen prefix across agent turns.
//!
//! ## The problem this solves
//!
//! llmtrim is a stateless MITM proxy: it compresses each request on its own. But agent
//! loops resend the *same* conversation plus one new turn every step — recent measurement
//! puts 85–95% of an agentic request's prompt tokens at unchanged turn-to-turn ("Stateful
//! Inference for Low-Latency Multi-Agent Tool Calling", 2026). Provider prefix caches
//! (Anthropic `cache_control`, OpenAI implicit) only pay out when the cached prefix is
//! **byte-identical** across calls.
//!
//! llmtrim's stages are deterministic per request but *context-sensitive*: retrieve's query
//! and RM3 expansion, the n-gram dictionary, and dedup all read the **whole** conversation —
//! so the compressed form of an *old* message can change when a *new* turn arrives. Two
//! consecutive turns then serialize a divergent prefix → the provider cache is busted → the
//! product's headline savings leak silently on exactly the highest-traffic (agent) shape.
//!
//! FlowKV (arXiv:2505.15347) and EpiCache (2025) formalize the fix: **freeze the past turns,
//! process only the new ones.** This memo is that idea at the request-rewrite layer — it does
//! not change any stage; it makes the *output* of a stage over an already-seen message prefix
//! reproducible byte-for-byte by remembering what we emitted last turn and reusing it verbatim.
//!
//! ## How it works (design)
//!
//! - **Key.** A cumulative 128-bit hash *chain* over the **original** bytes of the request's
//!   conversation messages (the `messages` / `input` / `contents` array, whichever the wire
//!   shape uses). `prefix_hash[k]` fingerprints original messages `0..=k`. Appending a new
//!   turn leaves every earlier `prefix_hash[k]` unchanged; changing one byte of an old message
//!   changes that boundary and every one after it.
//! - **Store.** An in-memory, size-capped, generation-evicted map from `prefix_hash[k]` to the
//!   **entire compressed conversation item** llmtrim emitted for original message `k` last time
//!   it was the head of a prefix (chat `messages[]` objects, Responses `input[]` items including
//!   `function_call` / `function_call_output`, Gemini `contents[]`, …). Storing the whole item —
//!   not only a `content` field — is required for agent wire shapes where the compressible text
//!   lives under `output` / `arguments` rather than `content`. No prompt text is read back from
//!   anywhere on disk — see *Privacy*.
//! - **Reuse.** On a new request, walk the original messages front-to-back; the longest run
//!   `0..=m` whose every boundary hash is present in the store is the *frozen prefix*. We still
//!   run the normal full-request pipeline (so all legend/injection/Stage-A logic stays exactly
//!   correct), then overwrite the frozen-prefix slots in the compressed output with the stored
//!   items — making them identical to last turn's output, which is what the provider cache keys
//!   on. Only the *suffix* (new messages) carries this turn's fresh content compression; the
//!   input-token gate still governs whatever was freshly compressed.
//! - **Record.** After rewriting, store this request's `(prefix_hash[k] -> compressed item)`
//!   for every conversation message **that is not already memoized** (first-write-wins), so
//!   the next turn can freeze one message further without ever remutating a prior freeze.
//!
//! ## Legend / instruction interaction & the v1 carve-out
//!
//! Most content stages compress each message *self-containedly* (retrieve prunes sentences,
//! dedup folds duplicate lines, hygiene/serialize reshape a message's own JSON, toolout windows
//! a message's own log) and any legend they inject is **static** text (the TOON `FORMAT_LEGEND`
//! is a build-time constant) — so reusing an earlier message's compressed bytes verbatim is
//! always sound.
//!
//! The **n-gram** stage is the exception: it rewrites content with placeholders (`§1`, `§2`, …)
//! whose assignment depends on phrase frequencies across the *whole* conversation, and injects a
//! one-time legend defining them. Splicing an old turn's `§`-encoded content into a new turn
//! whose legend numbers the placeholders differently would corrupt it. Rather than reach into
//! stage internals (out of scope) to freeze the dictionary, **v1 disables reuse whenever the
//! n-gram stage is enabled** (`config.ngram`) — the one stage where post-hoc splicing is unsafe.
//! Every other preset (`agent`, `rag`, `code`, `cache`, `safe`, …) gets turn-stable prefixes.
//! Freezing the n-gram dictionary over a frozen prefix is the natural v2.
//!
//! ## Fallbacks (the memo is an optimization, never a correctness dependency)
//!
//! Any mismatch or doubt falls back to full stateless compression (today's behavior): a
//! non-array conversation, an unexpected message-count delta between the original and the
//! compressed output (some stage restructured the array), the n-gram carve-out, or simply a
//! cold prefix. The memo can only ever make an *already-correct* compressed request reuse bytes
//! it itself produced for an identical earlier message.
//!
//! ## Privacy (SECURITY.md: prompt text is never persisted to disk)
//!
//! The store lives **only in process memory** and is never written to disk, logged, or sent
//! anywhere — the same in-memory-only treatment the `serve` proxy already gives prompt bytes.
//! Keys are 128-bit hashes of the original prefix (not the text). Values are the compressed
//! conversation items — which are *already* in flight to the provider on this very request — so
//! the memo retains nothing the proxy isn't already handling in memory for the duration of the
//! call. It is size-capped (LRU/generation eviction) so memory stays bounded on a long-running
//! daemon.
