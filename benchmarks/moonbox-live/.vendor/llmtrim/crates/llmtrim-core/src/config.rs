//! Pipeline configuration + embedded assets.
//!
//! Config resolves from `LLMTRIM_PRESET` / a `preset = "<name>"` key (a named profile) or the
//! per-stage flags in a TOML file (`LLMTRIM_CONFIG` or the platform config dir); with neither,
//! the default is `auto` (shape-routing). See [`DenseConfig::load`].
//!
//! # Two TOML crates, on purpose
//!
//! **Read with `toml`. Write with `toml_edit`. Never write back a parsed `toml::Value`.**
//!
//! Reads use `toml`, which has serde integration and an ergonomic `Value` API. Writes go
//! through `toml_edit`, which edits a document in place and so preserves the comments, key
//! order, and spacing a hand-edited config file carries.
//!
//! The rule exists because breaking it is silent. Parsing to `toml::Value` and re-serializing
//! with `to_string_pretty` produces valid TOML and passes any round-trip test, while deleting
//! every comment the user wrote. `edit_sub_table_at` did exactly that on every `llmtrim sub`
//! invocation until #200, and its own doc comment recorded the loss as if it were a design
//! choice. A new writer that copies the surrounding read code will reintroduce it.
