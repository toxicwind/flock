//! Zero-model per-request quality gating — the "will this cut hurt?" signal.
//!
//! The token gate ([`crate::pipeline`]) proves a lossy stage *saves* tokens. It is
//! blind to *how*: a stage that deletes the answer-bearing sentence saves tokens too.
//! This module supplies the missing axis — does query-relevant source content
//! *survive* the cut — using pure n-gram arithmetic, no model, no embeddings,
//! deterministic and language-universal (tokenization via the shared Unicode
//! `lex_words`).
//!
//! Two measures, after Grusky, Naaman & Artzi, "Newsroom" (NAACL 2018):
//!
//! - **Coverage** — the fraction of query-relevant source units that survive into the
//!   compressed text. (Grusky's coverage is the fraction of the *summary* drawn from
//!   the source; for compression the load-bearing direction is the inverse — what
//!   share of the *source* the model still needs is retained.) This is the hard gate:
//!   below [`COVERAGE_THRESHOLD`] a lossy content stage is reverted exactly like a
//!   token-gate failure.
//! - **Density** — the mean length of the maximal extractive fragments shared between
//!   source and compressed (Grusky's greedy fragment matching). Diagnostic only: it
//!   has **no obvious universal threshold** (its scale depends on segment length and
//!   the kind of text), so it is reported in telemetry, never gated on. Returned
//!   alongside coverage so a report can show "we kept 0.9 of the query content in
//!   fragments averaging 6 tokens".
//!
//! ## Calibrating [`COVERAGE_THRESHOLD`]
//!
//! The constant is set by split-conformal calibration ([`calibrate_threshold`]) so
//! that reverting below it gives a distribution-free guarantee: on exchangeable
//! traffic, a kept (non-reverted) compression retains at least `target_recall` of the
//! answer-bearing content with probability ≥ `1 − alpha`
//! (arXiv:2509.20461, "Document Summarization with Conformal Importance Guarantees").
//! To re-run against a real corpus: load recall cases (e.g. LongBench / ZeroSCROLLS
//! via `load_corpus`), compress each with the target preset,
//! compute `coverage(source, compressed, query_terms)` per case alongside the known
//! `recall(must_keep)`, then call `calibrate_threshold(&scored, 0.9, 0.1)` and paste
//! the returned value here. The shipped value is calibrated on the synthetic fixture
//! in the tests below (conservative; tighten with bench data).
