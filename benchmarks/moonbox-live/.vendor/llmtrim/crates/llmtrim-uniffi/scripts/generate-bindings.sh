# Generate UniFFI foreign-language bindings for llmtrim from one Rust definition.
#
# Emits glue for Python, Ruby, Swift and Kotlin into <out-dir>/<lang>/. The generated
# files are build artifacts (their internal checksums are pinned to the compiled library's
# ABI), so they are NOT committed — regenerate them per release alongside the native lib.
#
# IMPORTANT: library-mode bindgen reads UniFFI metadata symbols from the cdylib, so it must
# run against an UNSTRIPPED build. The workspace release profile sets `strip = true`, which
# removes those symbols — hence this script generates from the (unstripped) debug build. The
# native library you actually ship can be a stripped `--release` cdylib of the same crate;
# the generated glue loads it by name (`libllmtrim_ffi`) regardless of optimization level.
#
# Usage: crates/llmtrim-uniffi/scripts/generate-bindings.sh [out-dir]   (default: ./bindings)
